    <p>There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and
      went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his
      guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats
      slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an
      omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his
      station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an
      extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages
      of the night before.</p>

  <div title="What is your quest?">
    <p>Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same
      oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which
      could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times
      by a butler's thumb.</p>

    <p>At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored
      lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening
      hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched
      to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and
      with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.</p>

    <p>By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived—no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones
      and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the
      beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the
      halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond
      the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until
      the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and
      enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.</p>
